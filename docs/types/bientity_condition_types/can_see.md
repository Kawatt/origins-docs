# Can See

[Bi-entity Condition Type](../bientity_condition_types.md)

Checks whether the straight path from the actor entity's eyes to the target entity's eyes is unobstructed.

Type ID: `origins:can_see`


### Fields

Field | Type | Default | Description
------|------|---------|------------
`shape_type` | [Shape Type](../data_types/shape_type.md) | `"visual"` | Determines how the ray-cast will handle blocks.
`fluid_handling` | [Fluid Handling](../data_types/fluid_handling.md) | `"none"` | Determines how the ray-cast will handle fluids. 


### Examples

```json
"bientity_condition": {
    "type": "origins:can_see"
}
```

This example will check if the straight path from the actor entity's eyes to the target entity's eyes is unobstructed. If the actor/target is behind a source/flowing fluid, is submerged in any kind of fluids, or behind a block that is not see-through (like Glass), the condition will return false.
