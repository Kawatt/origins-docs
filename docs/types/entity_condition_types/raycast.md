### Examples

```json
"condition": {
    "type": "origins:raycast",
    "distance": 6,
    "block": true,
    "entity": true,
    "shape_type": "visual",
    "fluid_handling": "any",
    "match_bientity_condition": {
        "type": "origins:target_condition",
        "condition": {
            "type": "origins:entity_type",
            "entity_type": "minecraft:wolf"
        }
    },
    "hit_bientity_condition": {
        "type": "origins:owner"
    }
}
