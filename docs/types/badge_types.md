# Badge Type

Badge Types determine how should a badge behave in the Origins GUI screen. Each badge has a type, specified with a `type` field in the JSON file. Which type a badge is defines which other fields it requires and supports.


### List of badge types

* [Crafting Recipe](badge_types/crafting_recipe.md)
* [Keybind](badge_types/keybind.md)
* [Sprite](badge_types/sprite.md)
* [Tooltip](badge_types/tooltip.md)
